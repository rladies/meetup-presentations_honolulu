Welcome to R-Ladies Honolulu 🌺
---
R-Ladies Honolulu welcomes individuals of all proficiency levels in R, whether you're just starting out or a seasoned R programmer eager to mentor, network, and enhance your skills. Our community, a non-profit organization, is dedicated to fostering the growth of members' R expertise through social, collaborative learning, and knowledge sharing. 

We are committed to promoting diversity in the R community, both locally and globally, as a local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/). We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our primary objective is to provide a safe and supportive environment for anyone identifying with a minority gender who shares an interest in or works with R. Upholding our founding principle, there are no fees associated with participation in any of our R-Ladies communities worldwide.

As part of the Global R-Ladies group, you can access our presentations, R scripts, and more below, and by exploring the [R-Ladies Global Github account](https://github.com/rladies).
